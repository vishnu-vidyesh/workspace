## Explanation
### Line 8: Path header
```
Path 1: VIOLATED (-0.893 ns) Setup Check
```

Path 1 = this is the first reported path. </br>
VIOLATED = this path doesn’t meet timing. </br>
(-0.893 ns) = slack (negative means failing by 0.893 ns). </br>
Setup Check = tool is checking that data arrives before the capture clock edge. </br>
/CK->TD → tool is describing the clock pin → data pin timing arc of the endpoint register. </br>

### Line 9: View
```
View: sfunc_ss0p81v125c_RCmax
```
This is the corner (timing library + RC parasitic view). </br>
ss0p81v125c = slow-slow corner at 0.81V, 125°C (pessimistic). </br>
RCmax = max RC parasitics corner. </br>
### Line 10: Group
```
Group: bus_sdio_gclk
```
This path belongs to the clock group defined on bus_sdio_gclk. </br>
Paths are grouped per clock domain for reporting. </br>

### Lines 11–14: Startpoint / Endpoint
```
Startpoint: (F) .../GB
Clock: (F) bus_sdio_gclk

Endpoint: (R) .../payload_reg_a_reg[0]/TD
Clock: (R) bus_sdio_gclk
```
Startpoint = launch flip-flop (or latch). </br>
(F) = “functional” (as opposed to test, false, etc). </br>
/GB = the Q output pin of the launching register. </br>
Endpoint = capture register’s data pin (TD). </br>
Both driven by the same clock bus_sdio_gclk. </br>
So it’s a reg-to-reg path within the same clock domain. </br>

### Lines 16–20: Timing origin
```
Capture       Launch
Clock Edge:+    2.500        1.250
Src Latency:+    0.000        0.000
Net Latency:+    0.000 (I)   -0.150 (I)
Arrival:=        2.500        1.100
```
Clock Edge = capture happens at 2.500 ns, launch at 1.250 ns. </br>
→ This is your clock period division. Likely period = 1.25 ns * 2 = 2.5 ns (400 MHz). </br>
Src Latency = no additional modeled source latency. </br>
Net Latency (I) = insertion delay from clock tree. </br>
Launch clock arrives earlier than ideal (negative 0.150). </br>
Capture clock arrives at 0.000. </br>
→ So there is clock skew helping or hurting. </br>
Arrival = the effective clock edge time used for timing math: </br>
Launch edge at 1.100 ns (1.250 – 0.150). </br>
Capture edge at 2.500 ns (2.500 + 0.000). </br>

### Lines 22–24: Requirements
```
Setup:-    0.079
Uncertainty:-    0.625
Required Time:=    1.796
```
Setup 0.079 = library setup time of the endpoint flop (time before clock edge data must be stable). </br>
Uncertainty 0.625 = clock uncertainty (jitter, variation) applied → shrinks available timing window. </br>
Required Time 1.796 = Capture edge (2.500) - setup (0.079) - uncertainty (0.625) = 1.796 ns. </br>
This is the latest the data can arrive and still meet setup. </br>

### Lines 25–26: Actual arrival
```
Launch Clock:=    1.100
Data Path:+       1.590
```
Launch Clock 1.100 = when data starts launching from the source register. </br>
Data Path 1.590 = how long the combinational + routing takes. </br>
Arrival time = 1.100 + 1.590 = 2.690 ns. </br>
(but you see 2.500 in the table because of formatting; detailed report shows actual accumulation). </br>

### Line 27: Slack
```
Slack:= -0.893
```
Slack = Required – Arrival = 1.796 – 2.689 ≈ -0.893 ns. </br>
Means the data arrives ~0.9 ns too late. </br>

## Summary
- Launch flop launches data at 1.100 ns. </br>
- Data takes 1.590 ns to travel through logic/nets. </br>
- So it arrives at capture flop at 2.689 ns. </br>
- Capture flop requires data to be there by 1.796 ns (after subtracting setup + uncertainty).
- So it’s late by 0.893 ns → setup violation.
